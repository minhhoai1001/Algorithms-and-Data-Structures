We will return to sorting later in the chapter. Searching is the algorithmic process of finding a particular item in a collection of items.

    "To analyze searching algorithms, we need to decide on a basic unit of computation. Recall that this is typically the common step that must be repeated in order to solve the problem. For searching, it makes sense to count the number of comparisons performed. Each comparison may or may not discover the item we are looking for. In addition, we make another assumption here. The list of items is not ordered in any way. The items have been placed randomly into the list. In other words, the probability that the item we are looking for is in any particular position is exactly the same for each position of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the item is not in the list, the only way to know it is to compare it against every item present. If there are n items, then the sequential search requires n comparisons to discover that the item is not there. In the case where the item is in the list, the analysis is not so straightforward. There are actually three different scenarios that can occur. In the best case we will find the item in the first place we look, at the beginning of the list. We will need only one comparison. In the worst case, we will not discover the item until the very last comparison, the $n^{th}$ comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the average case? On average, we will find the item about halfway into the list; that is, we will compare against $\\frac{n}{2}$ items. Recall, however, that as n gets large, the coefficients, no matter what they are, become insignificant in our approximation, so the complexity of the sequential search, is $O(n)$. Table 1 summarizes these results.\n",

Not only is 54 not the item we are looking for, but no other elements beyond 54 can work either since the list is sorted.

In the sequential search, when we compare against the first item, there are at most n−1 more items to look through if the first item is not what we are looking for. Instead of searching the list in sequence, a binary search will start by examining the middle item. If that item is the one we are searching for, we are done. If it is not the correct item, we can use the ordered nature of the list to eliminate half of the remaining items. If the item we are searching for is greater than the middle item, we know that the entire lower half of the list as well as the middle item can be eliminated from further consideration. The item, if it is in the list, must be in the upper half.\n",
