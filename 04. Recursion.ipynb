    "* To understand that complex problems that may otherwise be difficult to solve may have a simple recursive solution.\n",

    "## 4.2. What Is Recursion?\n",
    "**Recursion** is a method of solving problems that involves breaking a problem down into smaller and smaller subproblems until you get to a small enough problem that it can be solved trivially. Usually recursion involves a function calling itself. While it may not seem like much on the surface, recursion allows us to write elegant solutions to problems that may otherwise be very difficult to program."

    "We will begin our investigation with a simple problem that you already know how to solve without using recursion. Suppose that you want to calculate the sum of a list of numbers such as: [1,3,5,7,9]. An iterative function that computes the sum is shown in ActiveCode 1. The function uses an accumulator variable (`theSum`) to compute a running total of all the numbers in the list by starting with 0 and adding each number in the list."

    "## 4.4. The Three Laws of Recursion\n",
    "Like the robots of Asimov, all recursive algorithms must obey three important laws:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A recursive algorithm must have a **base case**.\n",
    "* A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case.\n",
    "* A recursive algorithm must call itself, recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at each one of these laws in more detail and see how it was used in the `listsum` algorithm. First, a base case is the condition that allows the algorithm to stop recursing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To obey the second law, we must arrange for a change of state that moves the algorithm toward the base case. A change of state means that some data that the algorithm is using is modified. Usually the data that represents our problem gets smaller in some way. In the `listsum` algorithm our primary data structure is a list, so we must focus our state-changing efforts on the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final law is that the algorithm must call itself. This is the very definition of recursion. Recursion is a confusing concept to many beginning programmers. As a novice programmer, you have learned that functions are good because you can take a large problem and break it up into smaller problems. The smaller problems can be solved by writing a function to solve each problem. When we talk about recursion it may seem that we are talking ourselves in circles. We have a problem to solve with a function, but that function solves the problem by calling itself! But the logic is not circular at all; the logic of recursion is an elegant expression of solving a problem by breaking it down into a smaller and easier problems."

    "## 4.5. Converting an Integer to a String in Any Base\n",
    "Suppose you want to convert an integer to a string in some base between binary and hexadecimal. For example, convert the integer 10 to its string representation in decimal as `\"10\"`, or to its string representation in binary as `\"1010\"`. While there are many algorithms to solve this problem, including the algorithm discussed in the stack section, the recursive formulation of the problem is very elegant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at a concrete example using base 10 and the number 769. Suppose we have a sequence of characters corresponding to the first 10 digits, like `convString = \"0123456789\"`. It is easy to convert a number less than 10 to its string equivalent by looking it up in the sequence. For example, if the number is 9, then the string is `convString[9]` or `\"9\"`. If we can arrange to break up the number 769 into three single-digit numbers, 7, 6, and 9, then converting it to a string is simple. A number less than 10 sounds like a good base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing what our base is suggests that the overall algorithm will involve three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reduce the original number to a series of single-digit numbers.\n",
    "2. Convert the single digit-number to a string using a lookup.\n",
    "3. Concatenate the single-digit strings together to form the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using integer division to divide 769 by 10, we get 76 with a remainder of 9. This gives us two good results. First, the remainder is a number less than our base that can be converted to a string immediately by lookup. Second, we get a number that is smaller than our original and moves us toward the base case of having a single number less than our base. Now our job is to convert 76 to its string representation. Again we will use integer division plus remainder to get results of 7 and 6 respectively. Finally, we have reduced the problem to converting 7, which we can do easily since it satisfies the base case condition of n<base, where base=10. The series of operations we have just performed is illustrated in Figure 3. Notice that the numbers we want to remember are in the remainder boxes along the right side of the diagram.\n",

The algorithm works correctly because we make the recursive call first on line 6, then we add the string representation of the remainder. If we reversed returning the `convertString` lookup and returning the `toStr` call, the resulting string would be backward! But by delaying the concatenation operation until after the recursive call has returned, we get the result in the proper order. This should remind you of our discussion of stacks back in the previous chapter."
