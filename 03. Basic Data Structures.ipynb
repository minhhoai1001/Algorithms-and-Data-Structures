    "## 3.2 What Are Linear Structures?\n",
    "We will begin our study of data structures by considering four simple but very powerful concepts. **Stacks**, **queues**, **deques**, and **lists** are examples of data collections whose items are ordered depending on how they are added or removed. Once an item is added, it stays in that position relative to the other elements that came before and came after it. Collections such as these are often referred to as linear **data structures**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear structures can be thought of as having two ends. Sometimes these ends are referred to as the “*left*” and the “*right*” or in some cases the “*front*” and the “*rear*.” You could also call them the “*top*” and the “*bottom*.” The names given to the ends are not significant. What distinguishes one linear structure from another is the way in which items are added and removed, in particular the location where these additions and removals occur. For example, a structure might allow new items to be added at only one end. Some structures might allow items to be removed from either end."

Now place books one at a time on top of each other. You are constructing a stack. Consider what happens when you begin removing books. The order that they are removed is exactly the reverse of the order that they were placed. Stacks are fundamentally important, as they can be used to reverse the order of items. The order of insertion is the reverse of the order of removal. Figure 3 shows the Python data object stack as it was created and then again as items are removed. "

To solve this problem we need to make an important observation. As you process symbols from left to right, the most recent opening parenthesis must match the next closing symbol (see Figure 4). Also, the first opening symbol processed may have to wait until the very last symbol for its match. Closing symbols match opening symbols in the reverse order of their appearance; they match from the inside out. This is a clue that stacks can be used to solve the problem.\n",

If at any time there is no opening symbol on the stack to match a closing symbol, the string is not balanced properly.

However, as you scan the postfix expression, it is the operands that must wait, not the operators as in the conversion algorithm above. Another way to think about the solution is that whenever an operator is seen on the input, the two most recent operands will be used in the evaluation.\n",

At this point, you are still unsure what to do with them until you see the next symbol. Placing each on the stack ensures that they are available if an operator comes next.\n",

When the final operator is processed, there will be only one value left on the stack. Pop and return it as the result of the expression.
