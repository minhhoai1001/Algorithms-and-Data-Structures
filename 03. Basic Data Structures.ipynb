    "## 3.2 What Are Linear Structures?\n",
    "We will begin our study of data structures by considering four simple but very powerful concepts. **Stacks**, **queues**, **deques**, and **lists** are examples of data collections whose items are ordered depending on how they are added or removed. Once an item is added, it stays in that position relative to the other elements that came before and came after it. Collections such as these are often referred to as linear **data structures**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear structures can be thought of as having two ends. Sometimes these ends are referred to as the “*left*” and the “*right*” or in some cases the “*front*” and the “*rear*.” You could also call them the “*top*” and the “*bottom*.” The names given to the ends are not significant. What distinguishes one linear structure from another is the way in which items are added and removed, in particular the location where these additions and removals occur. For example, a structure might allow new items to be added at only one end. Some structures might allow items to be removed from either end."

    "## 3.3. What is a Stack?\n",
    "A **stack** (sometimes called a “push-down stack”) is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end. This end is commonly referred to as the “top.” The end opposite the top is known as the “base.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The base of the stack is significant since items stored in the stack that are closer to the base represent those that have been in the stack the longest. The most recently added item is the one that is in position to be removed first. This ordering principle is sometimes called **LIFO**, **last-in first-out**. It provides an ordering based on length of time in the collection. Newer items are near the top, while older items are near the base.\n",

    "One of the most useful ideas related to stacks comes from the simple observation of items as they are added and then removed. Assume you start out with a clean desktop. Now place books one at a time on top of each other. You are constructing a stack. Consider what happens when you begin removing books. The order that they are removed is exactly the reverse of the order that they were placed. Stacks are fundamentally important, as they can be used to reverse the order of items. The order of insertion is the reverse of the order of removal. Figure 3 shows the Python data object stack as it was created and then again as items are removed. "

    "## 3.5. Implementing a Stack in Python\n",
    "As we described in Chapter 1, in Python, as in any object-oriented programming language, the implementation of choice for an abstract data type such as a stack is the creation of a new class. The stack operations are implemented as methods. Further, to implement a stack, which is a collection of elements, it makes sense to utilize the power and simplicity of the primitive collections provided by Python. We will use a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the list class in Python provides an ordered collection mechanism and a set of methods. For example, if we have the list [2,5,3,6,7,4], we need only to decide which end of the list will be considered the top of the stack and which will be the base. Once that decision is made, the operations can be implemented using the list methods such as `append` and `pop`."

    "## 3.6. Simple Balanced Parentheses\n",
    "The challenge then is to write an algorithm that will read a string of parentheses from left to right and decide whether the symbols are balanced. To solve this problem we need to make an important observation. As you process symbols from left to right, the most recent opening parenthesis must match the next closing symbol (see Figure 4). Also, the first opening symbol processed may have to wait until the very last symbol for its match. Closing symbols match opening symbols in the reverse order of their appearance; they match from the inside out. This is a clue that stacks can be used to solve the problem.\n",
